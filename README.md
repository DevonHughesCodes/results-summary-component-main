## Overview

A couple of months back, this challenge was pretty difficult for me. Mainly when it came to the left and right container orientation on mobile and desktop. However after much practice and pointer from the awesome community on Frontend Mentor, I was able to solve this challenge with relative ease. Thank you Frontend Mentor community for everything so far!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
